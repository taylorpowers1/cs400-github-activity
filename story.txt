  I was a person determined to do one thing. I had one goal which was to scroll to the 
absolute last page of the Internet. I don't know what possessed me to have this goal, 
but I started scrolling one day and I never turned back. There was no button to click 
through pages, so I had to scorll. The day finally came where I knew I would reach the 
absolute last page. After many long days of scrolling, I finally reached the official
end of the Internet. This was the message I was greeted with...

  This is a strange string of English letters: "dtzfwjwjfqqdxrfwy". It must be a 
cryptography I thought. I could not wait to reveal the secret behind this sting. I 
recalled the Caesar cipher the instructor taught a few days ago. So I try to decrypt 
this string in this way. I switch different keys and finally when key is 5 the string 
turn to "youarereallysmart". I thought I found the secret behind.

  The truth was there was no secret. The page in front of me was yet another new web page.
I stared at the page and the blank page stared back, mocking me. I got frustrated as it 
stared. Why bother continuing the game? The thought suddenly came to me. Yeah, why not 
just throw away the whole thing and simply leaveï¼Ÿ So I stood up and walked out of the
room I didn't realize I was in. Facing the bright sunlight, I opened my eyes to see the
world unfolding before me. The world was blank, like the web page.
